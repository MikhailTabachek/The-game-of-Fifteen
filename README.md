**About the game.**

The 15 puzzle (also called Gem Puzzle, Boss Puzzle, Game of Fifteen, Mystic Square and many others) is a sliding puzzle having 15 square tiles numbered 1â€“15 in a frame that is 4 tiles high and 4 tiles wide, leaving one unoccupied tile position. Tiles in the same row or column of the open position can be moved by sliding them horizontally or vertically, respectively. The goal of the puzzle is to place the tiles in numerical order.

**How to play.**

Chose the level of the game between **Hard** and **Not Hard** ðŸ˜Š

In the *Hard mode*, you only have 2 minutes to solve the puzzle.
In *Not Hard* mode you have 5 minutes.
The game starts after you click on a Play button.
Once game is started, click or tap on a square with a number, to move it to the empty spot.
Squares can move vertically and horizontally only. Your goal is to order all 15 tiles.

You can get to the *unsolvable* combination - if all numbers from 1 to 13 will be in an increasing order, but then the square with number 15 will be placed before the square with number 14.

**How I built this game.**

My name is Mikhail. When I was a kid, I used to play this puzzle game a lot. In February of 2022, I had to pick a game to build for a project at General Assembly SEI coding bootcamp. This puzzle game was the first, that popped in my head. I started planning this game by drawing a sketch in a [wireframe.](https://wireframe.cc/9JOIhw)

Once the sketch was finished, I've structured and wrote a pseudo code. It was my roadmap to build this game from scratch.

It took me four days to get to the point, when the game was fully functional and ready to play. Then it was presented to my classmates, and they found few bugs. I was fixing them on the go, after every reported problem. This helped me to make user experience flawless. I hope you will enjoy playing this game.

What I've learned after I built this game:

* Detailed planning is very important before starting any project
* A good function have to do one thing at a time. That way it's easier to trubleshoot down the road.
* To take breaks every few hours to avoid tireness and lack of motivation
* Let other people use the product and find the issues that I may not found
* Ask for help if something takes more than an hour to fix

My future plans for this game:

* Add sounds to the game
* Add an option for user to automaticaly save the best score
* Add global score board so player could compare the score with other people
* Add themes and preferred color scheme
* Create mini online competitions between few players
